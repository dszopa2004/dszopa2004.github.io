        <p class="my-info">
          Throughout the summer of 2023 (May - September), I was an intern at
          River Trails School District 26. During my internship at RTSD26, I was
          able to learn how to manage servers, repair and troubleshoot
          Chromebooks, write Powershell scripts to automate tasks such as
          downloading antivirus, and how to help teachers with any technology
          complications.

        <p class="my-info">
          I was an associate at Kohl's from August 2022 to December 2022. While
          I was an associate there, I had to ensure that customers had a proper
          and satisfactory experience. I needed to help the customer find
          whatever they were looking for. I also worked in the Amazon Returns
          department, where I had to complete returns for customers. This
          involved scanning QR codes and sorting the items into boxes. I also
          had to learn how to overcome language barriers so that the customer
          had a fluid experience.
